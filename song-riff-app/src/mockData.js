    "Do you ever feel like a plastic bag",
    "Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?",
    "Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin",
    "Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?",
    "'Cause baby, you're a firework",
    "Come on, show 'em what you're worth",
    "Make 'em go, 'Oh, oh, oh'",
    "As you shoot across the sky"

  "Party in the U.S.A.": [
    "I hopped off the plane at LAX",
    "With a dream and my cardigan",
    "Welcome to the land of fame excess",
    "Am I gonna fit in?",
    "Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time",
    "Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign",
    "This is all so crazy",
    "Everybody seems so famous",
    "So I put my hands up, they're playing my song",
    "The butterflies fly away"
  ],
  "Drive By": [
    "On the other side of a street I knew",
    "Stood a girl that looked like you",
    "I guess that's deja vu",
    "But I thought this can't be true",
    "'Cause you moved to west LA",
    "Or New York or Santa Fe",
    "Or wherever to get away from me",
    "Oh, but that one night",
    "Was more than just right"
  ],
  "Sugar": [
    "I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down",
    "I need your loving, loving, I need it now",
    "When I'm without you, I'm something weak",
    "You got me begging, begging, I'm on my knees",
    "I don't wanna be needing your love",
    "I just wanna be deep in your love",
    "Sugar, yes please",
    "Won't you come and put it down on me?"

  "The Sweet Escape": [
    "If I could escape",
    "I would",
    "But first of all let me say",
    "I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way",
    "'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor",
    "It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator",
